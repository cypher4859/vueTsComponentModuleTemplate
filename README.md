# vueTsComponentModuleTemplate
The is a template for a new component to be used within a scaffolded VueTS Project from the VueTS Template.

A basic workflow would be to clone the vueTsTemplate to scaffold a new VueTS vuetify project. That new project will come bundled with a components directory which you can add new components into. Those new components should follow the same structure as this repository, vueTsComponentModuleTemplate. For any additional components you'd like to build you can simply traverse to the `@/components/` directory and clone this repo which will scaffold out a new component.
